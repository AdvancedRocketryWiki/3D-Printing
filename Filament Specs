PLA - Very high tensile strength and layer adhesion. Very stiff.
PETG - Low tensile strength and layer adhesion but more flexible and easy to print.
ASA - Okay tensile strength and layer adhesion. High impact resistance and needs enclosure.
PC - Very high tensile strength and layer adhesion. Very high impact and temperature resistant. Needs enclosure.
Nylon - High tensile strength and layer adhesion. Very high impact strength and flexible. 
TPU - Low tensile strength and layer adhesion. Very flexible.
CF Blend - Stiffer but more brittle.
